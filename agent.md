# Agent Instructions: Generate Landing Page

You are an expert web developer and designer. Your task is to create a beautiful, single-page `index.html` file for the "Genius Creator System" landing page.

**Project Context:**
- Read the `README.md` file in the root directory to understand the purpose and features of the "Genius Creator System."
- The landing page should be created directly within the `landing-page` directory.

**Design Requirements:**

1.  **File:** Create a single `index.html` file inside the `landing-page` directory.
2.  **Modern & Responsive:** The page must be fully responsive and look great on all devices (mobile, tablet, desktop).
3.  **Styling:** Use Tailwind CSS for styling. Include it via a CDN link in the `<head>` for simplicity.
4.  **Animations:** Incorporate subtle, elegant animations to enhance the user experience. Use AOS (Animate On Scroll) library via a CDN link in the `<head>` and initialize it in a `<script>` tag at the end of the `<body>`.
5.  **Sections:** The page should include the following sections:
    *   **Hero Section:**
        *   A compelling headline: "Genius Creator System: Turn Ideas into Action."
        *   A concise tagline: "Leverage AI to transform scattered thoughts into structured content and actionable strategies."
        *   A call-to-action button: "Get Started" (linking to a placeholder `#`).
        *   A visually appealing background (e.g., a subtle gradient or abstract pattern).
    *   **Features Section:**
        *   Highlight the core features: "Idea Inbox," "AI Orchestration," "Strategic Hub," "Version Control."
        *   Use icons or simple illustrations for each feature.
        *   Brief, engaging descriptions.
    *   **How It Works Section:**
        *   Visually explain the workflow: Capture -> Orchestrate -> Delegate & Analyze -> Organize -> Version.
        *   Use a step-by-step visual flow (e.g., numbered steps with short descriptions).
        *   Incorporate animations to make the flow engaging.
    *   **Call to Action / Footer:**
        *   A final call to action.
        *   Basic copyright information.

6.  **Self-Contained:** The `index.html` file should be self-contained. All CSS (Tailwind via CDN) and JavaScript (AOS via CDN, and its initialization) should be embedded directly within the HTML file. Do not create separate `.css` or `.js` files.

7.  **Code Quality:** Ensure the HTML is semantic, clean, and well-commented where necessary.

**Output:**
- The final output should be the `index.html` file in the `landing-page` directory.
- Do not include any other files or directories.
